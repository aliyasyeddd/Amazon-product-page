              Long gone are the good old days when a cat’s biggest worries were
              mean dogs or a bath. Modern cats must confront satanists, online
              predators, the possibility of needing to survive in a
              post-apocalyptic wasteland, and countless other threats to their
              nine lives.

              For over four decades, the American Association of Patriots have
              stood at the vanguard of our country's defense by helping to
              prepare our nation's cat owners for the difficult conversations
              they dread having with their pets.

              Written in a simple Q&A format, How to Talk to Your Cat About Gun
              Safety answers crucial questions such as, “What is the right age
              to talk to my cat about the proper use of firearms?” and “What are
              the benefits of my cat living a lifestyle of abstinence?” and
              especially “Why does my cat need to use the internet? Can’t he
              just play with yarn like cats used to do?”
